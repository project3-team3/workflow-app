      "tipText": "The first step toward work-life balance is taking advantage of breaks that are offered to you, such as a lunch break. If you work from home, consider taking a quick stretch and walking around the block to get some fresh air. You can also take mini breaks at your desk and practice breathing exercises or short meditations."

      "tipText": "If possible, consider working from home — or, if you’re an employer, consider offering work-from-home options for your employees. According to Jabra's Hybrid Ways of Working 2022 Global Report, employees with full autonomy to choose where they work are happier with their jobs."

    {
      "tipText": "A flexible work schedule allows employees the autonomy to create their own schedules to determine a work-life balance that fits the needs of their personal lives. This could mean starting and ending the workday at earlier or later times or hybrid working, depending on personal preferences."

    {
      "tipText": "If you feel like you’re having a tough time practicing work-life balance and things are feeling hectic, don’t be too hard on yourself — we’re only human. Practicing self-compassion and being kinder to yourself can go a long way when navigating challenges and mistakes."

    {
      "tipText": "Paid time off exists for a reason. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 48 percent of workers fail to use all of their allocated vacation days. If you find yourself not taking advantage of your vacation days, consider planning time off in advance so you don’t forget. Take time off even if it’s just for a mental health day or a staycation."

      "tipText": "Donating to a cause you care about can help give you a sense of purpose and boost morale. When you encourage yourself or your employees to donate and be part of other charitable events, you can further promote a positive work environment, which can lead to a better overall work-life balance."

    {
      "tipText": "Make it a point to schedule some time to socialize, whether it's with your friends, family, or even colleagues after work. Quality time with people you care about can be a great way to break up the day and relax if you’re stressed about work or other responsibilities. Plus, having healthy social relationships are important for overall mental and physical health, which can translate into the workplace."

      "tipText": "If you’re feeling overwhelmed with a task list that seems to be piling up, make a to-do list and prioritize the top tasks first. Focusing on these bigger items and crossing them off your list right away can give you a sense of productivity and accomplishment, which can set the tone for the rest of your day."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Be sure to prioritize communicating your boundaries to colleagues and clients in the workplace. This includes communicating the hours you plan on working and when you’re available to respond. Communicating these boundaries can help reduce the need to check on work after hours or on your time off."

    {
      "tipText": "Leaning on a mentor or a work-life balance coach can also be a great resource if you’re looking to improve your work-life balance. Not only can a mentor help you practice balance, but they can also help you get the promotion you’ve been working toward or present you with a new career opportunity by giving advice and navigating whichever industry you’re in. To find the right fit, make sure you clearly state your goals and trajectory."

      "tipText": "Exercise in any form can be a great stress reducer, making it an essential part of an everyday routine. Try to sneak exercise into your day, even if it’s just a quick five-minute meditation session in the morning, stretches at your office chair, or a run around the neighborhood after work."

      "tipText": "Sometimes people don’t know work-life balance is an issue until it’s brought up. If applicable, you can fill out surveys or feedback forms to give input on work-life balance within the company. It’s also important as an employer to ensure you’re fostering healthy communication in the workplace. That means creating a culture that encourages feedback and allows employees to feel heard and appreciated."

    {
      "tipText": "If you feel like you’re struggling to achieve a healthy work-life balance, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Whether it’s your boss, a mentor, or even a therapist, seek advice and tips from others in your network. Sometimes, employers will even offer employee assistance programs that can connect you with a professional who can help you manage stress and put you on the right path to a better work-life balance."

    {
      "tipText": "Don’t strive for the perfect schedule; strive for a realistic one. Some days, you might focus more on work, while other days you might have more time and energy to pursue your hobbies or spend time with your loved ones. Balance is achieved over time, not each day."

      "tipText": "Although work is an expected societal norm, your career shouldn’t be miserable. If you hate what you do, you aren’t going to be happy, plain and simple. You don’t need to love every aspect of your job, but it needs to be exciting enough that you don’t dread getting out of bed every morning."

    {
      "tipText": "Your overall physical, emotional and mental health should be your main concern. If you struggle with anxiety or depression and think therapy would benefit you, fit those sessions into your schedule, even if you have to leave work early or ditch your evening spin class. If you are battling a chronic illness, don’t be afraid to call in sick on rough days. Overworking yourself prevents you from getting better, possibly causing you to take more days off in the future."

      "tipText": "Cutting ties with the outside world from time to time allows us to recover from weekly stress and gives us space for other thoughts and ideas to emerge. Unplugging can mean something simple like practicing transit meditation on your daily commute instead of checking work emails."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Sometimes, truly unplugging means taking vacation time and shutting off work completely for a while. Whether your vacation consists of a one-day staycation or a two-week trip to Bali, it’s important to take time off to physically and mentally recharge."

    {
      "tipText": "When planning time with your loved ones, create a calendar for romantic and family dates. It may seem weird to plan one-on-one time with someone you live with, but it will ensure that you spend quality time with them without work-life conflict. Just because work keeps you busy doesn’t mean you should neglect personal relationships."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Set boundaries for yourself and your colleagues to avoid burnout. When you leave the office, avoid thinking about upcoming projects or answering company emails. Consider having a separate computer or phone for work so you can shut it off when you clock out. If that isn’t possible, use separate browsers, emails or filters for your work and personal platforms."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Pay attention to when your most productive work time is, and block that time off for your most important work-related activities. Avoid checking your emails and phone every few minutes, as those are major time-wasting tasks that derail your attention and productivity. Structuring your day can increase productivity at work, which can result in more free time to relax outside of work."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Whether you are at home or at the office, it is critical to make use of your time efficiently. Don’t let personal issues spill over to the workplace, and equally, if not more important, keep your work issues at the office. Remote workers, or individuals who work from home may have a more difficult time drawing a line in the sand between work and life. Time is the most valuable commodity in life: it is the one thing you cannot buy more of."

      "tipText": "Be realistic, but make sure your goals challenge you. Are you satisfied with your compensation? If not, consider bringing this up to your boss. Compensation is a major cause of employee dissatisfaction and turnover."

    {
      "tipText": "Part of maintaining a healthy work life balance is establishing priorities both at home and at the office. There are only so many hours in the day and it is up to you what will get the most of your time, attention, and energy. The first thing people need to do is identify what truly matters to them and communicate it. It is no one else’s job but your own to put yourself first. Work will suffer if you do not have time for yourself outside of it."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Emails can really put a strain on your productivity levels if you are not reviewing them in an efficient manner. Set aside time to review emails when you first get in, consider checking in intervals, or at a certain time each day. Don’t get overwhelmed when you see things streaming into your inbox. Respond in a timely manner, but don’t let a new email send you off task with what you’re currently focused on."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "It’s imperative to remain happy at home regardless of how your work life is going. Most humans rely on the future as a natural motivator, and by setting goals for your future at home (this does not include career goals) you are automatically making your personal happiness a priority. This is the key! Think exercise, travel, new hobbies, reserving time for friends and family, the list goes on."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "People fail to recognize the importance of “me” time. It’s inevitable, sometimes you have to finish up work late at night, or early in the morning. If that is the case, make sure you take at least a few hours off when you get home. Relax, make some dinner, get some exercise and then get back to it. You will be more focused and driven if you give yourself a bit of time to unwind in between sessions."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Food is fuel and sometimes it takes a lack of healthy options to realize you need to change your habits. When people work full-time, especially in an office setting, it is not unusual to snack throughout the day or eat unhealthy lunches. If you find yourself letting go of your healthy habits, it’s time to change. The types of food you eat greatly affect your mood, sleeping patterns, and overall health."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "The numbers of hours required for a full night’s rest varies greatly from one individual to the next, but the chances are, you need at least seven. Listen to your body and get to rest when you are run-down. Don’t over-exert yourself when you know you have a full day of work the next day. Get on a schedule and try to turn off all gadgets, including TV, social media, and internet at least 30 minutes before you go to bed."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "One of the most critical things that we as humans need to thrive is exercise. So why is it so often left on the backburner in terms of healthy priorities? Exercise is an effective stress reducer. It pumps feel-good endorphins through your body. It helps lift your mood and can even give you increased energy levels!"

    {
      "tipText": "There is a reason our gadgets have off buttons—use them! Start to commit to reducing the amount of time you spend with technology after getting home from the office/finishing up your work for the day. Staring at a computer screen for 7 hours a day has incredibly negative effects on your mood and energy, take a step back once you have a moment to breathe."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "One of the greatest lessons to learn as you grow through your career is to pace yourself. At times, you will need to set the fast forward button to get you through a challenging task or time. Other times, you will need to slow down, even take a few steps back to really concentrate on your current responsibility. Self-awareness is crucial. Doing so will help you enjoy the journey as much as the destination."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "The chances are, you have a perfectionist amongst you at the office. This person doesn’t try to stress out over every little thing, but from a young age, they learned to put their all into what they do. This is a positive in some cases, but will eventually drain the energy of most workers."
    },
    {
      "tipText": "Make time for hobbies, passions, and relationships outside of work. Consider keeping a list of things you would like to do (just for fun) and start checking them off this week! Set aside a certain number of hours per day or days per week that you are going to commit to your passions and making yourself a better person."
